# AirBnB clone - The console

## Description
In the first phase of our project, we're building a simple version of Airbnb. We've created a basic console using Python to help us manage different parts of the project. This console can do things like creating, showing, updating, listing, and deleting items in our project. It's just the beginning, as we plan to improve and add more features in the next phases.
